Systems
=======
A **voting system** is the combination of rules which define how a final result,
and ultimately consensus, will be determined during a vote.  All voting systems
are composed of three important pieces: ballot, choices, and tallying method.

Choices
-------
A voting systems **choices**, or **options**, are the set of choices that a
voting actor can select from.

Ballot
------
A **ballot** is the means through which voting actors express their vote. The
structure of the ballot influences exactly *how* the voter can express their
vote.

Tallying Method
