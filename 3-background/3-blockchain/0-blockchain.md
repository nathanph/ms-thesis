Blockchain Technology
=====================
A blockchain is a distributed transactional database system that tracks
transactions in ever-growing linked blocks. Blockchain technology has
been used to create immutable (?) public ledgers for tracking currency, assets,
and rights data. The most notable technology leveraging blockchain technology
today is Bitcoin.

Blockchain technology exists to provide a solution to the Byzantine Generals'
Problem in a distributed computing environment. It allows parties on an
untrusted and unreliable network to build a trusted source of truth. A
blockchain uses an algorithm to score different versions of history to reach
consensus in the network.
