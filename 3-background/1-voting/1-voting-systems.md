Systems
=======
A **voting system** is the combination of rules which define how a final result,
and ultimately consensus, will be determined during a vote.  All voting systems
are composed of three important pieces: ballot, choices, and tallying method.

Choices
-------
A voting system's **choices**, or **options**, are the set of choices that a
voting actor can select from. The choices available may be determined by primary
vote, write-in, or some combination of the two. 

### Representative Democracy
In a **representative democracy**, choices are candidates who are meant to
represent their constitutes. A **republic** is an example of a representative
democracy.

#### Indirect Election
An **indirect election** is a vote where actors vote for persons who then elect
a candidate themselves. The electoral college used in the United States is an
example of this. When voting actors cast their vote for a particular candidate
they're actually voting for **electors**, members of the electoral college who
are typically aligned with the candidate's party. These electors are expected to
vote for the candidate who wins the majority vote in a their state. In all but
two states the electors are "winner-take-all", that is, if a candidate wins the
popular vote in a state, e.g., by 50.1%, then all of the electors selected for
that state will be electors aligned with the winning candidate.

#### Direct Election
A **direct election**, in contrast to an indirect election, is a vote where a
voting actor's votes are cast directly for a candidate.



Ballot
------
A **ballot** is the means through which voting actors express their vote. The
structure of the ballot influences exactly *how* the voter can express their
vote for choice or choices.
