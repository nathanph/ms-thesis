Voting
======
Systems, Theory, and Practice
-----------------------------
**Voting** is a means to come to consensus as a group; the goal of which should
be reaching a consensus which reflects the preferences of the participating
actors in the fairest way possible. Voting, at first glance, seems like a
trivial problem, and perhaps is under most inconsequential circumstances (a
small group of actors with limited choices). However, voting quickly becomes a
difficult problem once the number of actors or choices increases. There are
mathematical constraints that voting systems are bound by. Beyond mathematical
constraints there are challenging social and engineering issues with which an
implemented voting system will be subject to.
