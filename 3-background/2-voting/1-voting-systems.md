Systems
=======
A **voting system** is the combination of rules which define how a final result,
and ultimately consensus, will be determined during a vote.  All voting systems
are composed of three important pieces: ballot, choices, and tallying method.

Choices
-------
A voting system's **choices**, or **options**, are the set of choices that a
voting actor can select from; they are the *who* or *what* being decided in a
vote. The choices available may be determined by primary vote, polling,
write-in, or some combination of techniques.

### Representative Democracy
In a **representative democracy**, choices are candidates who are meant to
represent their constituents. A **republic** is an example of a representative
democracy.

#### Indirect Election
An **indirect election** is a vote where actors vote for persons who then elect
a candidate themselves. The electoral college used in the United States is an
example of this. When voting actors cast their vote for a particular candidate
they're actually voting for **electors**, members of the electoral college who
are typically aligned with the candidate's party. These electors are expected to
vote for the candidate who wins the majority vote in a their state. In all but
two states the electors are "winner-take-all", that is, if a candidate wins the
popular vote in a state, e.g., by 50.1%, then all of the electors selected for
that state will be electors aligned with the winning candidate.

#### Direct Election
A **direct election**, in contrast to an indirect election, is a vote where a
voting actor's votes are cast directly for a candidate.

Ballot
------
A **ballot** is the means through which voting actors express their vote. The
structure of the ballot influences exactly *how* the voter can express their
preferences for a choice or choices. This is directly influenced by the
tallying method. Ballots, in some texts, are regarded to as a *process* of
voting; here we use it to describe the medium through which a voting actor marks
their choice (e.g., paper, punch card, or electronic machine), and the rules
regarding how they can mark said medium.

Tallying Method
---------------
The tallying method is closely tied to how you're allowed to mark your ballot
and affects how your marked ballot is ultimately counted in the final tally.

### Plurality Voting
A **plurality vote** system is one where

> A plurality voting system is a voting system in which each voter is allowed to
> vote for only one candidate, and the candidate who polls more votes than any
> other candidate (a plurality) is elected.

### Majority Voting
A **majority vote** system is one where

### Ranked Voting
A **ranked vote** system is one where
> Preferential voting or rank voting describes certain voting systems in which
> voters rank outcomes in a hierarchy on the ordinal scale (ordinal voting
> systems). When choosing between more than two options, preferential voting
> systems provide a number of advantages over first-past-the-post voting (also
> called plurality voting). This does not mean that preferential voting is the
> best system; Arrow's impossibility theorem proves that no preferential method
> can simultaneously obtain all properties desirable in a voting system.[Mankiw
> 1][1] There is likewise no consensus among academics or public servants as to
> the best electoral system.

#### Ordinal Voting
An **ordinal vote** system is one where


#### Cardinal Voting
A **cardinal vote** system is one where

##### Approval Voting
An **approval vote** system is one where

### Proxy Voting
A **proxy vote** system is one where

Conclusion
----------
The choices affect *who/what* you vote for, the ballot affects *how* you express
your vote, and the tallying method affects the way your expressed vote impacts
the final results.
