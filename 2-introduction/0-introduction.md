We are forced to make decisions every day. Some decisions are simple. What do I
eat for dinner? What do I wear today? Other decisions are more difficult. What
politician should I vote for? Which stocks should I invest in? This decision
making process is complicated, and becomes even more so when we try to make
decisions as a group.

All organizations have power structures through which decisions are made.
Democratic societies aim to make decisions by granting and counting individuals'
votes. This process is complicated in practice, but in theory helps to provide a
fairer and more balanced society. Unfortunately, the difficulties of actually
implementing such a system can lead to imbalances, fraud, and corruption.
Gerrymandering, vote buying, and private interests are real-world examples of
the shortcomings a democratic society might incur.

The growing usage and near-ubiquitous nature of the internet and personal
computers offers a new medium through which a vote could be cast. Online voting
might offer solutions to alleviate some of the shortcomings previous democratic
institutions have been victim to. However, online voting has been shown to have
many of its own risks associated with it.

Here online voting, its feasibility, scalability, security, and potential
implementations are explored. In particular, blockchain technologies are
considered as a means to address some of the issues and risks that have been
shown to exist in other voting systems.  Ultimately, could a transactional,
decentralized, secure, verifiable, and electronic voting system exist?
