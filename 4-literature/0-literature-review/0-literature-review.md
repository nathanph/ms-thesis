Democracy is a fundamental birthright for Americans, a cherished blessing which
serves as the foundation for our freedom. Each generation must nourish and
foster the processes of their democracy so that future generations may too reap
the benefits it provides. Key to democracy is the right to vote. By voting the
citizens of a democratic society can express their will to their governing body.
The goal of any voting system should be that the outcome fairly represents the
will of the people.

For thousands of years societies have practiced democracy, held elections, and
casted votes. Technology, and its applications within voting systems, has
developed markedly since then. Today the Internet pervades our lives in the form
of websites, applications, peripherals and more --- used for social media,
banking, e-commerce, and everything in-between --- this leads one wonder why it
is that we haven't seen more progress in the form of Internet-based voting.
Constituents, election officials, businesses, counties, states, even entire
countries have requested and experimented with such systems. Internet security
is robust enough to support a $100 billion industry, e-commerce, which suggests
that an Internet-based voting system is at least plausible.

We've seen contentious election results both locally and abroad, as well as
issues that cast doubt and concern on the validity of our democratic processes:
voter suppression, gerrymandering, intimidation, ballot stuffing, destruction of
audit material, etc. Internet based voting systems might help to alleviate some
of these concerns. Research on end-to-end verifiable voting has seen much
progress in the past few years. However, Internet voting brings with it an
entirely new set of security risks and concerns that must also be addressed.

The legitimacy of a government depends on public perception. Thus, election
security is a matter of national security. Voters must be certain that their
votes have not unfairly manipulated or tallied to modify election results,
they must feel that universal suffrage is being upheld, that all those who are
eligible to vote have had the opportunity to do so, that each voter has had
precisely one vote, that each vote is of equal weight, and that the privacy of
each voter has been maintained.

Voting is the means through which we express ourselves. If voters lose faith in
their election system they will lose faith in their election results, their
elected leaders, and their democracy. Trustworthy democracy is an ambitious and
worthy goal that every government should strive to realize.


Contentious Elections
---------------------
Despite having had thousands of years to improve on our election systems we
continue to see contentious election results both locally and abroad. What
follows are some of the more egregious and contentious election results.

### American Elections

#### Bush vs Gore (2000 - United States)


#### Trump vs Clinton (2016 - United States)
> "A 58 percent majority of Clinton supporters say they accept Trump’s election,
> while 33 percent do not. Questions about Trump’s victory are passionate — 27
> percent of Clinton supporters feel “strongly” he did not win legitimately."

### Foreign Elections

#### Gortari vs Cárdenas (1988 - Mexico)


End-to-end Verifiable Voting
----------------------------
Recall that an E2E-V (end-to-end verifiable) voting system provides the
following features for voters:

- check that the system recorded their votes correctly,
- check that the system included their votes in the final tally, and
- count the recorded votes and double-check the announced outcome of the
  election.

What follows are examples of E2E-V that exist currently.

### Demos

### Helios

### Norwegian System

### Remotegrity

### RIES

### Wombat

### vVote



Internet Voting
---------------
There have been many attempts to bring online voting to the masses

> "Aggressive early adoption of election technology must be tempered by a clear
> understanding that voters’ trust in their elections is hard-won and easily
> lost."







Booth Voting
------------
Voting booths are used ubiquitously across the world. A voting booth is
typically considered to be a small room with curtains in place to protect a
voter's privacy.
