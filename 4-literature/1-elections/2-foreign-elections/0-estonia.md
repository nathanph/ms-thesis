Estonia
-------
Estonia began using Internet voting in 2005. By the 2015 Estonian parliamentary
elections 30.5% of all voters voted over the Internet. Estonia maintains what
are probably the most advanced national identification cards in the world.
Estonian IDs are part of a **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** where IDs serve
as smart cards which possess two RSA key pairs: one for signing and one for
authentication. Cryptographic functions are performed on the card. The
signatures produced by the IDs are used extensively throughout the country and
are legally binding. These cryptographic IDs allow Estonia to provide voter
authentication capabilities that cannot be reproduced in the US. Despite the
advanced authentication capabilities that Estonia offers researchers in 2014
devised a number of attacks that could be performed on the Estonian voting
system to spoil ballots, damage ballot secrecy, and steal/drop votes. The
researchers also criticized the transparency and operational security of the
system.
