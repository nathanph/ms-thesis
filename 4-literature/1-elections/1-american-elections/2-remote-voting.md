Early and Remote Voting
=======================
Early voting, technically, is a service that allows voters to vote before
election day. In that regard, all states provide some form of early voting,
namely, absentee voting (guaranteed through UOCAVA to overseas citizens).
However, early voting generally refers to in-person absentee voting, where a
voter casts their vote at an official polling location before Election Day.

Early voting has become a popular means of voting for American citizens. In the
1980s fewer that 5% of ballots cast in the general election were cast before
election day, by 2000 16% percent of votes for president were cast early, and by
2012 the number of votes casted early had risen to at least 31%.
