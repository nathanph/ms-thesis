Legislation
===========
Interestingly, neither the Bill of Rights nor the US Constitution originally
spelled out any right to vote, active suffrage, for the citizens of its
democracy. It wasn't until the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified that the right
to vote for citizens and the protections for citizen's right to vote were
finally recognized at a federal level. In total we've had four separate
amendments to the Constitution which concern voting rights:

- **Fifteenth Amendment** - Racial suffrage (1870)
  > The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or
  > abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or
  > previous condition of servitude.
- **Nineteenth Amendment** - Sexual suffrage (1920)
  > The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or
  > abridged by the United States or by any on account of sex.
- **Twenty-fourth Amendment** - Financial suffrage (1964)
  > The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other
  > election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice
  > President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied
  > or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay
  > any poll tax or other tax.
- **Twenty-sixth Amendment** - Age suffrage (1971)
  > The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other
  > election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice
  > President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied
  > or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay
  > any poll tax or other tax.

The United States still does not offer universal suffrage to its citizens, e.g.,
felons are disenfranchised.

There are several major pieces of legislation relevant to voting rights. Many of
these statutes provide basic voting rights and others go further to ensure that
these rights are upheld for various demographics via varied enforcement
policies.

Voting Rights Act
-----------------
Although the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution was ratified in 1870 it
wasn't until the **Voting Rights Act (VRA)**, passed in 1965, that the Fifteenth
Amendment was actually enforced. The act laid out a number of provisions used to
regulate election administration. Prior to the VRA southern states would
disenfranchise racial minorities via Jim Crow laws, election fraud, voter
restrictions: literacy tests, poll taxes, property-ownership requirements, moral
character tests, requirements that voter registration applicants interpret
particular documents, etc.

Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act
---------------------------------------------------
The **Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA)** was passed
in 1986 to render services to merchant marines, uniformed services, and other
overseas civilians. Specifically, UOCAVA mandates that overseas and military
voters be able to remotely register and vote in federal elections. The **Federal
Voting Assistance Program (FVAP)**, established under the **Department of
Defense (DOD)**, provides voter assistance, tools, and education to overseas
voters so that they are able to vote from anywhere in the world.

National Voter Registration Act
-------------------------------
The **National Voter Registration Act (NVRA)**, also known the **Motor Votor
Act**, was federal law passed in 1993 that came into effect in 1995. The NRVA's
goal was to increase voter registration, enhance voter participation, protect
election security, and ensure states maintain accurate voter rolls. This was
done by combining voter registration with obtaining a driver's license.

> The NVRA effectively forced every state to offer voter registration in
> combination with the single civic act performed almost universally by American
> adults --- obtaining a driverâ€™s license.

Help America Vote Act
---------------------
The **Help America Vote Act (HAVA)**, passed in 2002, was legislation passed to
lower barriers disabled people encountered while attempting to vote.  HAVA also
aimed to improve vote auditing after a large number of ballots in the 2000
election were rejected. HAVA recommended that all election systems use
**Verifiable Voter Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT)** and worked to create statewide
voter registration lists and identification requirements.

HAVA was also responsible for the formation of the United States **Election
Assistance Commission (EAC)**. The EAC is responsible for testing, certifying,
and decertifying voting equipment; developing voting machine standards; and
administering funds to states so that they become HAVA compliant.

The EAC requested that the **National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST)** create a **Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG)** which cover
equipment, documentation, and testing requirements of voting machines.

> The purpose of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines is to provide a set of
> specifications and requirements against which voting systems can be tested to
> determine if they provide all the basic functionality, accessibility and
> security capabilities required to ensure the integrity of voting systems. The
> VVSG specifies the functional requirements, performance characteristics,
> documentation requirements, and test evaluation criteria for the national
> certification of voting systems

HAVA also established provisional ballots for states that don't allow same-day
registration. Provisional ballots allow voters to cast a ballot on election day
if the voter feels they're entitled to vote but are not listed as being
registered. The ballot is counted after the voter's eligibility has been
verified with the goal being that no voter is turned away who should have
otherwise been able to vote.

Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act
-------------------------------------------
The **Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act (MOVE)**, passed in 2009,
amended UOCAVA and other statues to provide further protections to eligible
citizens.  Specifically the act aimed to reduce the number of ballots that are
not counted due to late receipt. MOVE accomplishes this by requiring that states
send absentee ballots no later that 45 days prior to election day. MOVE goes
further by requiring that all registration material and blank ballots be
available electronically as well as removes requirements regarding notarization
on voting applications and ballots.
