Voting
======
Voting procedure varies depending on state legislation. Here we review early
voting, remote voting, and Internet voting by state. Remote voting is a form of
early voting and Internet voting a form of remote voting.

Early Voting
------------
**Early voting** is a service that allows voters to cast ballots before election
day during a specified time frame at a polling location. Some states offer early
voting through **in-person absentee voting**: a voter receives a ballot through
mail or internet, marks said ballot, then casts their vote at an official
polling location before Election Day.

Early voting has become a popular means of voting for American citizens. In
the 1980s fewer that 5% of ballots cast in the general election were cast before
election day, by 2000 16% percent of votes for president were cast early, and by
2012 the number of votes casted early had risen to at least 31%.

### Arguments
Proponents of early voting would argue that early voting makes the voting
process more convenient for citizens, thus increasing voter turnout. Voters
would have more flexibility to work around children, jobs, doctor's
appointments, out of state trips, as well as be able to avoid long lines on
election day.

Critics argue that those concerns are less important when compared to the risks
it presents.

> Citizens should vote with a common base of information about candidates. If
> they vote over a period of weeks before Election Day, they vote based on the
> knowledge available on a scattering of different dates.

Remote Voting
-------------
**Remote voting**, in contrast to early voting, is any form of voting where
ballots are not marked and cast at an official polling place. Remote voting is
also known as **absentee voting**. The medium through which a marked absentee
ballot is returned to election officials depends on the state.

### Arguments
Remote voting offers flexibility above and beyond early voting. Remote voting
allows voters to vote from the comfort of their own homes, overseas, and even
from space. However, there are risks associated with remote voting:
voter intimidation, vote buying, vote manipulation, etc.

> Growing use of absentee voting has turned this area of voting into the most
> likely opportunity for election fraud now encountered by law enforcement
> officials. These cases are especially difficult to prosecute, since the misuse
> of a voter’s ballot or the pressure on voters occurs away from the polling
> place or any other outside scrutiny. These opportunities for abuse should be
> contained, not enlarged.

Electronic Voting
-----------------
**Electronic voting (e-voting)** is the use of electronic systems to cast and/or
count votes. Electronic voting can be split into two main categories **Direct
Recording Electronic (DRE)** voting machines and **optical scan voting
systems**. A DRE machine records votes electronically in memory. An optical scan
voting system reads ballots using scanning technology, much like Scantrons in
the academic world.


### Arguments
The promise of electronic voting is that it would be a faster, more transparent,
secure, and accurate form of voting. Other benefits would include greater ballot
language support, increased support and independence for handicapped people,
less printing costs, and the ability to entirely prevent spoiled ballots.

Unfortunately the promises of electronic voting have fallen short several times.
Security researchers have repeatedly demonstrated methods of attacking various
e-voting machines to manipulate votes casted or the tallying process itself. As
a result most states no longer offer e-voting without a **Verifiable Voter Paper
Audit Trail (VVPAT)**.

Proponents and vendors of electronic voting would claim that their systems are
rigorously tested, but security experts argue otherwise.

> Election law in most states requires that all voting systems—whether
> electronic or not—be qualified by an authorized federally licensed laboratory
> known as an Independent Testing Authority (ITA), and then submitted to the
> state for certification. The ostensible purpose of these procedures it to make
> sure that the voting system meets the voluntary federal voting system
> standards promulgated by the FEC (and in the future, by NIST), and that they
> conform to the state’s election laws. It is tempting to place a lot of faith
> in certification procedures as a means for preventing security failures. We
> believe such faith is unwarranted. We argue that even a lengthy, conscientious
> testing and examination program by the most qualified people cannot give us
> the necessary security guarantees. In fact, in general, no process can, since
> in most cases the problem of establishing that a program meets any particular
> security requirement is known to be fundamentally unsolvable.


> There are fundamental limits to what testing can accomplish; it is a truism of
> the software world that while testing can be used to verify that bugs and
> security vulnerabilities are present, it can never prove that they are absent.


> Contrary to many people’s intuition, it is unlikely in the extreme that
> anyone, whether on the development team or not, would detect malicious logic
> that was deliberately disguised by a clever programmer, no matter how much
> effort was put into the search. It is much easier to hide a needle in a
> haystack than to find it.

Internet Voting
---------------
We define **Internet voting** as any form of voting where a marked ballot is
transfered over a network, this includes transfer via fax, email, or web
application (fax being included because of the widespread proliferation and
usage of Internet-based fax machines).

There have been many attempts to bring about online voting in the US and abroad.
Over $100 million in federal funding and decades of research and development has
been spent on internet voting systems.

> In 2000 there were several other experiments with Internet voting in U.S.
> public elections. In some cases the votes counted officially; in others they
> did not. The largest and most well-known was the Arizona Democratic
> presidential primary, conducted by election.com (whose assets were acquired in
> 2003 by Accenture) in March of that year, in which approximately 85,000 votes
> were cast and counted. The Reform Party national primary was also conducted
> over the Internet that summer, as were various nonbinding Internet voting
> experiments in some counties of Washington, California, Arizona and elsewhere.

### Arguments
Internet voting would provide all of the benefits of early, remote, and
electronic voting while also inheriting all of their risks and some. The major
additional risk is that Internet voting exposes the entire system to remote
attack from anywhere in the world and the possibility for large-scale attacks.

The conclusion of research initiatives and academic research is that Internet
voting is fundamentally impossible to accomplish while maintaining voter
privacy, audit trails, and preventing large scale attacks.

> it is currently not possible to ensure the security, privacy, auditability and
> integrity of ballots cast over the Internet.

> ...
>
> federal researchers determined that secure online voting is not currently
> feasible
>
> ...
>
> The conclusive evidence that online voting cannot yet be done securely led the
> federal government to abandon its effort to develop a secure online voting
> system for the military in 2014.


> It is reasonable to assume that the shortcomings of ITAs with respect to DREs
> will carry over to their certification of Internet voting.

"A comment on the May 2007 DoD report on Voting Technologies for UOCAVA Citizens"
made the following arguments against voting systems:

* Paperless (non-VVPAT) voting systems have been widely criticized: closed
  source software, insufficient scruity, insider attack potential, and no VVPAT.
* Cyber attack potential: insider attacks, denial of service attacks, spoofing,
  automated vote buying, viral attacks, etc.
* Attacks could occur at a large-scale and launched by individual, corporate, or
  state actors that may lie outside the reach of US law. Attacks could result in
  widespread or selective voter disenfranchisement, vote buying/selling, vote
  switching, etc. These attacks are capable of being perpetrated without
  detection.
* These vulnerabilities cannot be eliminated without a wholesale redesign and
  replacement of both the internet and PC.
* Seemingly successful Internet voting systems may appear to work flawlessly,
  promoting expansion of an insecure system.
* Not detecting a successful attack does not mean that one has not occurred.
* Because the threat of large-scale cyber attacks is so great, "we recommend
  against any Internet voting until both the Internet and the world's home
  computer infrastructure have been fundamentally redesigned."

### Demonstrated Attacks

#### Voting Over the Internet
The **Voting Over the Interet (VOI)** system

#### Secure Electronic Registration and Voting Experiment
The **Secure Electronic Registration and Voting Experiment (SERVE)** was an
internet voting system built under the DOD's FVAP to be deployed for the 2004
elections. The goal was to produce a voting system that reduced barriers for
American voters living overseas.

1. Certain elections may be held entirely by mail. The circumstances under which
   all-mail elections are permitted vary from state to state.
2. Although these states do not have Early Voting in the traditional sense,
   within a certain period of time before an election they do allow a voter to
   apply in person for an absentee ballot (without an excuse) and cast that
   ballot in one trip to an election official’s office. This is often known as
   "in-person absentee" voting.
3. Massachusetts has Early Voting only during even-year November elections,
   beginning in 2016. Currently it does not permit Early Voting in primaries or
   municipal elections.
