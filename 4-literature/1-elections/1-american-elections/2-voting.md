Voting
======
Voting procedure varies from state to state depending on state legislation. Here
we review early voting, remote voting, and Internet voting by state.

Early Voting
------------
**Early voting** is a service that allows voters to cast ballots before election
day during a specified time frame at a polling location. Some states offer early
voting through **in-person absentee voting**: a voter receives a ballot through
mail or internet, marks said ballot, then casts their vote at an official
polling location before Election Day.

Early voting has become a popular means of voting for American citizens. In
the 1980s fewer that 5% of ballots cast in the general election were cast before
election day, by 2000 16% percent of votes for president were cast early, and by
2012 the number of votes casted early had risen to at least 31%.

There are many arguments for and against early voting. For example, proponents
would argue that early voting makes the voting process more convenient for
citizens, thus increasing voter turnout; critics would argue that

> Citizens should vote with a common base of information about candidates. If
> they vote over a period of weeks before Election Day, they vote based on the
> knowledge available on a scattering of different dates.

> Growing use of absentee voting has turned this area of voting into the most
> likely opportunity for election fraud now encountered by law enforcement
> officials. These cases are especially difficult to prosecute, since the misuse
> of a voter’s ballot or the pressure on voters occurs away from the polling
> place or any other outside scrutiny. These opportunities for abuse should be
> contained, not enlarged.


Early voting is a useful process to have available for citizens and has been

Remote Voting
-------------
**Remote voting**, in contrast to early voting, is any form of voting where
ballots are not marked and cast at an official polling place. Remote voting is
also known as **absentee voting**. The medium through which an absentee ballot
is required to be transmitted to election officials depends on the state.

1. Certain elections may be held entirely by mail. The circumstances under which
   all-mail elections are permitted vary from state to state.
2. Although these states do not have Early Voting in the traditional sense,
   within a certain period of time before an election they do allow a voter to
   apply in person for an absentee ballot (without an excuse) and cast that
   ballot in one trip to an election official’s office. This is often known as
   "in-person absentee" voting.
3. Massachusetts has Early Voting only during even-year November elections,
   beginning in 2016. Currently it does not permit Early Voting in primaries or
   municipal elections.
