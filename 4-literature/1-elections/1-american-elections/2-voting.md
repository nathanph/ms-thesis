Voting
======
Voting procedure varies depending on state legislation. Here we review early
voting, remote voting, and Internet voting by state. Remote voting is a form of
early voting and Internet voting a form of remote voting.

Early Voting
------------
**Early voting** is a service that allows voters to cast ballots before election
day during a specified time frame at a polling location. Some states offer early
voting through **in-person absentee voting**: a voter receives a ballot through
mail or internet, marks said ballot, then casts their vote at an official
polling location before Election Day.

Early voting has become a popular means of voting for American citizens. In
the 1980s fewer that 5% of ballots cast in the general election were cast before
election day, by 2000 16% percent of votes for president were cast early, and by
2012 the number of votes casted early had risen to at least 31%.

### Arguments
There are many arguments for and against early voting. Proponents of early
voting would argue that early voting makes the voting process more convenient
for citizens, thus increasing voter turnout. Voters would have more flexibility
to work around children, jobs, avoid long lines on election day, etc.

Critics would argue otherwise.

> Citizens should vote with a common base of information about candidates. If
> they vote over a period of weeks before Election Day, they vote based on the
> knowledge available on a scattering of different dates.

> Growing use of absentee voting has turned this area of voting into the most
> likely opportunity for election fraud now encountered by law enforcement
> officials. These cases are especially difficult to prosecute, since the misuse
> of a voter’s ballot or the pressure on voters occurs away from the polling
> place or any other outside scrutiny. These opportunities for abuse should be
> contained, not enlarged.

without excuse or justification:

Remote Voting
-------------
**Remote voting**, in contrast to early voting, is any form of voting where
ballots are not marked and cast at an official polling place. Remote voting is
also known as **absentee voting**. The medium through which an absentee ballot
is required to be transmitted to election officials depends on the state.

Remote voting offers flexibility above and beyond early voting. Remote voting
allows voters to vote from the comfort of their own homes, overseas, and even
from space. However, there are risks associated with remote voting:
voter intimidation, vote buying, vote manipulation, etc.

Electronic Voting
-----------------
**Electronic voting (e-voting)** is the use of electronic systems to cast and/or
count votes. The promise of electronic voting was that it would be a faster,
more transparent, secure, and accurate form of voting. Unfortunately the
promises of electronic voting fell flat several times. Security researchers
repeatedly demonstrated methods of attacking various e-voting machines to
manipulate votes casted or the tallying process.

**Direct Recording Electronic (DRE)**

**Verifiable Voter Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT)**

### Criticisms

> Election law in most states requires that all voting systems—whether
> electronic or not—be qualified by an authorized federally licensed laboratory
> known as an Independent Testing Authority (ITA), and then submitted to the
> state for certification. The ostensible purpose of these procedures it to make
> sure that the voting system meets the voluntary federal voting system
> standards promulgated by the FEC (and in the future, by NIST), and that they
> conform to the state’s election laws. It is tempting to place a lot of faith
> in certification procedures as a means for preventing security failures. We
> believe such faith is unwarranted. We argue that even a lengthy, conscientious
> testing and examination program by the most qualified people cannot give us
> the necessary security guarantees. In fact, in general, no process can, since
> in most cases the problem of establishing that a program meets any particular
> security requirement is known to be fundamentally unsolvable.


> There are fundamental limits to what testing can accomplish; it is a truism of
> the software world that while testing can be used to verify that bugs and
> security vulnerabilities are present, it can never prove that they are absent.


> Contrary to many people’s intuition, it is unlikely in the extreme that
> anyone, whether on the development team or not, would detect malicious logic
> that was deliberately disguised by a clever programmer, no matter how much
> effort was put into the search. It is much easier to hide a needle in a
> haystack than to find it.

> there are some things that we know about how ITAs have evaluated computerized
> touch screen machines (DREs), and there are other things that we can deduce
> from some glaring failures in the DREs that were not detected by the ITAs. It
> is reasonable to assume that the shortcomings of ITAs with respect to DREs
> will carry over to their certification of Internet voting.

Internet Voting
---------------
We define **Internet voting** as any form of voting where a marked ballot is
transfered over a network, this includes transfer via fax, email, or web
application (fax being included because of the widespread proliferation and
usage of Internet-based fax machines).

There have been many attempts to bring about online voting in the US.


> In 2000 there were several other experiments with Internet voting in U.S.
> public elections. In some cases the votes counted officially; in others they
> did not. The largest and most well-known was the Arizona Democratic
> presidential primary, conducted by election.com (whose assets were acquired in
> 2003 by Accenture) in March of that year, in which approximately 85,000 votes
> were cast and counted. The Reform Party national primary was also conducted
> over the Internet that summer, as were various nonbinding Internet voting
> experiments in some counties of Washington, California, Arizona and elsewhere.

### Attacks

#### Voting Over the Internet
The **Voting Over the Interet (VOI)** system

#### Secure Electronic Registration and Voting Experiment
The **Secure Electronic Registration and Voting Experiment (SERVE)** was an
internet voting system built under the DOD's FVAP to be deployed for the 2004
elections. The goal was to produce a voting system that reduced barriers for
American voters living overseas.

1. Certain elections may be held entirely by mail. The circumstances under which
   all-mail elections are permitted vary from state to state.
2. Although these states do not have Early Voting in the traditional sense,
   within a certain period of time before an election they do allow a voter to
   apply in person for an absentee ballot (without an excuse) and cast that
   ballot in one trip to an election official’s office. This is often known as
   "in-person absentee" voting.
3. Massachusetts has Early Voting only during even-year November elections,
   beginning in 2016. Currently it does not permit Early Voting in primaries or
   municipal elections.
