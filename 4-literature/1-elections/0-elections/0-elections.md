Elections
=========
Should this section actually be "remote voting"?


There have been many attempts to bring online voting to the masses.  We define
Internet voting as any form of voting where a marked ballot is transfered over a
network, this includes transfer via fax, email, or web application (fax being
included because of the widespread proliferation and usage of Internet-based fax
machines).

What follows is a review of Internet-based voting systems and the policies
concerning them.

American Elections
------------------
American elections are a massive and complicated undertaking filled with
federal, state, and local legislation.

31 states in America support Internet-based voting in one form or another.

25 of these states

### Overseas Voting and Remote Voting
> According to estimates from the United States Elections Project, there were
> 5,127,418 UOCAVA eligible voters for the 2012 U.S. general election and
> 5,345,814 for the 2014 U.S. general election.

#### Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act
The **Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA)** was passed
in 1986 to render services to merchant marines, uniformed services, and other
overseas civilians. Specifically, UOCAVA mandates that overseas and military
voters be able to remotely register and vote in federal elections.

#### National Voter Registration Act
The **National Voter Registration Act (NVRA)**, also known the **Motor Votor
Act**, was federal law passed in 1993 that came into effect in 1995. The NRVA's
goal was to increase voter registration, enhance voter participation, protect
election security, and ensure states maintain accurate voter rolls. This was
done by combining voter registration with obtaining a driver's license.

> The NVRA effectively forced every state to offer voter registration in
> combination with the single civic act performed almost universally by American
> adults --- obtaining a driverâ€™s license.

#### Help America Vote Act
The **Help America Vote Act (HAVA)**, passed in 2002, was legislation passed to
lower barriers disabled people encountered while attempting to vote.  HAVA also
aimed to improve vote auditing after a large number of ballots in the 2000
election were rejected. HAVA recommended that all election systems use
**Verifiable Voter Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT)** and worked to create statewide
voter registration lists and identification requirements.

HAVA was also responsible for the formation of the United States **Election
Assistance Commission (EAC)**. The EAC is responsible for testing, certifying,
and decertifying voting equipment; developing voting machine standards; and
administering funds to states so that they become HAVA compliant.

The EAC requested that the **National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST)** create a **Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG)**.

> The purpose of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines is to provide a set of
> specifications and requirements against which voting systems can be tested to
> determine if they provide all the basic functionality, accessibility and
> security capabilities required to ensure the integrity of voting systems. The
> VVSG specifies the functional requirements, performance characteristics,
> documentation requirements, and test evaluation criteria for the national
> certification of voting systems

#### Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act
The **Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act (MOVE)**, passed in 2009,
amended UOCAVA and other statues to provide further protections to eligible
citizens.  Specifically the act aimed to reduce the number of ballots that are
not counted due to late receipt. MOVE accomplishes this by requiring that states
send absentee ballots no later that 45 days prior to election day. MOVE goes
further by requiring that all registration material and blank ballots be
available electronically as well as removes requirements regarding notarization
on voting applications and ballots.
