End-to-End Verifiability
------------------------
An **End-to-End Verifiabile (E2E-V)** voting system is a system that provides
the following features for voters:

- allows voters to check that the system recorded their votes correctly,
- allows voters to check that the system included their votes in the final
  tally, and
- allows voters to count the recorded votes and double-check the announced
  outcome of the election.

E2E-V voting systems have been a hotbed of research over the past several years.
An **End-to-End Verifiable Internet Voting (E2E-VIV)** is an E2E-V voting system
that allows you to vote over the Internet.
